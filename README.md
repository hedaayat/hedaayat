# Hey, I'm Marc 👋

**Entrepreneur | Cybersecurity | AI**  
📍 Toronto, Canada

---

I've spent 40+ years building technology and leading teams. Now I'm focused on helping SMBs protect their data and leverage AI — without giving it all to the cloud.

### 🔨 What I'm Building

- **[Human Firewall](https://github.com/hedaayat/human-firewall-app)** — Cybersecurity awareness training that turns employees from the weakest link into the first line of defense
- **Private AI Appliance** — On-premise AI solutions for businesses who want the power of AI without the data privacy concerns

### 🧠 What I Care About

- **Security is human** — Technology alone won't protect you. People will.
- **AI should be private** — Your business data shouldn't train someone else's model.
- **Build things that matter** — Less talk, more shipping.

### 💼 Background

Founder of **Rayonnance** and veteran of 200+ technology projects across industries. I've built teams, systems, and companies. Now I'm doing it again in Canada.
